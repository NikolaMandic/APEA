# MyApp123

To start your new Phoenix application you have to:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix router with `mix phoenix.start`
you might need symlinks in order for this to be fully functional like described here 
http://nikola.link/?p=77
Now you can visit `localhost:5000` from your browser.


## Notes

* If you choose to change the application's structure, you could manually start the router from your code like this `MyApp123.Router.start`
